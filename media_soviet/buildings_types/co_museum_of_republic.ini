//This museum is dedicated to the long and rich history of the republic. The lower floor invites visitors to take in the various 
//artistic acehivements of the country's most talented citizens, while the spire showcases some of the more recent revolutionary
//works, such as the modernisation of old city centers and the defeat of fascism in the great patriotic war. At the very top
//visitors are invited to look out of the panoramic windows and witness for themselves the changed landscpe and natural beauty of the country.
